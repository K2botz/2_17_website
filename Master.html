    <h3>Origin/Impact</h3>
  <main>
    <p>Little is known of The Master before he was mutated. What is known is that his name used to be Richard Moreau and that he was exiled from vault city (murder suspect) and later changed his surname to Grey. He later travled to the hub and became a doctor and later met a trader by the name of Harold. Together they formed a joint expidetion to find the source of the mutants attacking Harolds caravan. There expidition led them to the mariposa military base where they group was overwhelmed by muntant forces. Grey was knocked into a vat of F.E.V(forced Evolutionary Virus). He stayed in that vat for over a month and pulled himself out where he began to mutate. After he fully mutated he stuck himself in a vault and named himself The Master. The Master realizing the power of F.E.V set out to make a master race and to end humanity. The Master had made his master race of Super Mutants and had sent them around new california to kill off the setttlements but his plans were thuartted by the Vault Dweller. The left over Super Mutants spread around new california and the rest of the commonwealths</P>
